            <ul>
              <li><p >A Website for hospital which will be design by using html css javascript php and using
bootstrap framework
In WeCare website I will design clean and responsive website UI for user where user can use
diffrent services of hospital without avoiding traveling.
Main Goal of my project is to target the hospitalization section where user can book appointment
check daily update of hospital,doctors ,available beds and many more.
This website will help any hospital or small clinic where user can take appointment of available
doctors.normally patient call at hospital/clinic to book appointment and if no one answers a call it
seems irritating to that person. but if you book appointment just opening website it will be really
reliable for user.and get all information just going at website will help that user.
